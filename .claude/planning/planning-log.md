# Planning Session History

## Deep Planning Session - 2025-07-25

### Memory Bank Review
**Current State Assessment**:
- **activeContext.md**: Memory Bank system setup is 90% complete with directory structure and core files initialized
- **progress.md**: Project health is Green with active development on dashboard implementations
- **systemPatterns.md**: Comprehensive architecture documentation with Next.js 15, shadcn/ui, and Zustand patterns
- **projectbrief.md**: Clear vision for multi-step authentication and dashboard application

### Strategic Analysis
**Goal Alignment**: Current work is well-aligned with establishing persistent context preservation system
**User Value**: Memory Bank system will significantly improve development efficiency between sessions
**Technical Risk**: Low - implementing documented patterns without disrupting existing architecture
**Resource Reality**: Time investment in Memory Bank setup will pay dividends in future productivity

### Progress Velocity
- **Current pace**: Fast - Core files created efficiently with comprehensive project context
- **Bottlenecks**: None currently identified
- **Efficiency gains**: Memory Bank system will eliminate context loss between sessions

### Forward Planning
**Next Major Milestone**: Complete Memory Bank system and implement settings page account context switching
**Timeline**: Memory Bank completion within current session, settings page within 1-2 weeks
**Success Criteria**: 
- All Memory Bank files properly initialized and functional
- Planning triggers and automation in place
- Settings page supports seamless personal/team account switching

### Memory Bank Action Items
- [x] Create core memory bank files (projectbrief, activeContext, systemPatterns, progress)
- [ ] Complete planning directory setup
- [ ] Create planning triggers and automation scripts
- [ ] Test Memory Bank system functionality

### Planning Session Outcome
**Key Decision**: Prioritize Memory Bank completion to establish foundation for improved development workflow
**Direction**: Continue with current implementation approach - minimal disruption, maximum utility
**Next Planning Session**: After Memory Bank system is fully operational
