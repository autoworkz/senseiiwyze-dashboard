# Active Context

## Current Focus
Implementing B2B2C Engine with multi-faceted dashboards (CEO, Worker, Frontliner) based on comprehensive implementation plan. Created 27 tasks organized in 3 phases.

## Last Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-07-26
**Completed**: 
- Analyzed B2B2C Engine Implementation Plan
- Created 27 actionable tasks across 3 phases
- Generated task tracking document in docs/tasks/b2b2c-engine-tasks.md
- Organized tasks by priority: 9 high, 9 medium, 9 low

**In Progress**:
- [ ] B2B2C Phase 1: Foundation tasks (authentication, routing, state management)
- [ ] Creating delegation groupings for parallel development

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Update Memory Bank with B2B2C implementation progress
2. Create delegation groupings for parallel task execution
3. Start Phase 1 high-priority tasks focusing on layout and authentication

## Current Mental Model
### Key Insights Discovered
- Project uses Next.js 15 with App Router and shadcn/ui component system
- Strict pnpm package manager requirement with enforcement mechanisms
- Multi-step authentication flow with account context switching capability
- Recent work focused on dashboard implementations (program readiness, executive, user)

### Active Decisions
- Memory Bank implementation: Following comprehensive system from user's documentation
- File organization: Using .claude/ directory structure as specified
- Integration approach: Minimal disruption to existing project structure

## Context for Next Session
The Memory Bank system is being established to provide persistent context between sessions. Core files are being initialized with current project state. The project has active development on dashboard components and authentication flow.

## Planning Status
**Last Planning Session**: Initial setup (current session)
**Next Planning Due**: After Memory Bank setup completion
**Strategic Alignment**: Green - Clear project vision and well-defined architecture patterns
