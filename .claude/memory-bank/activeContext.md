# Active Context

## Current Focus
Setting up Memory Bank system integration for improved context preservation between Claude Code sessions.

## Last Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-07-25
**Completed**: 
- Merged comprehensive memory bank concept into CLAUDE.md
- Integrated Memory Bank & Planning System documentation
- Preserved all existing project guidance and architecture patterns

**Completed**:
- Memory Bank directory structure fully established
- All core memory bank files initialized with project context
- Planning directory and automation scripts implemented
- Git hook integration for planning triggers tested and working

**In Progress**:
- [ ] Begin next major milestone: settings page account context switching implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Review Memory Bank system functionality and validate completeness
2. Begin work on account context switching for settings page
3. Continue dashboard integration tasks as identified in project plans

## Current Mental Model
### Key Insights Discovered
- Project uses Next.js 15 with App Router and shadcn/ui component system
- Strict pnpm package manager requirement with enforcement mechanisms
- Multi-step authentication flow with account context switching capability
- Recent work focused on dashboard implementations (program readiness, executive, user)

### Active Decisions
- Memory Bank implementation: Following comprehensive system from user's documentation
- File organization: Using .claude/ directory structure as specified
- Integration approach: Minimal disruption to existing project structure

## Context for Next Session
The Memory Bank system is being established to provide persistent context between sessions. Core files are being initialized with current project state. The project has active development on dashboard components and authentication flow.

## Planning Status
**Last Planning Session**: Initial setup (current session)
**Next Planning Due**: After Memory Bank setup completion
**Strategic Alignment**: Green - Clear project vision and well-defined architecture patterns
