# Progress Tracking

## Current Status
**Phase**: Development
**Version**: In progress (multiple dashboard implementations)
**Health**: Green - Active development with clear architecture patterns

## What's Working
- **Authentication System**: Multi-step flow with social auth (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Consistent component system with semantic theming
- **State Management**: Zustand with localStorage persistence functioning well
- **Package Management**: pnpm enforcement working across all scripts and workflows
- **Dashboard Components**: Executive, user, and program readiness dashboards implemented
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Cloudflare Workers deployment via @opennextjs/cloudflare
- **Form Validation**: Zod schemas with custom utilities for robust validation

## What's Broken/Incomplete
- [ ] Backend API integration (priority: medium) - currently using mock data
- [ ] Settings page account context switching (priority: high) - partially implemented
- [ ] Real-time data streaming capabilities (priority: low) - not yet started
- [ ] Advanced user role management (priority: medium) - basic structure exists
- [ ] Test coverage expansion (priority: medium) - TDD approach established but coverage needs improvement

## Recent Milestones
- **2025-07-25**: Memory Bank system setup for context preservation
- **Recent**: Program Readiness Dashboard implementation completed
- **Recent**: Executive Dashboard implementation completed  
- **Recent**: Added comprehensive shadcn/ui component system
- **Recent**: Enforced pnpm package manager with multiple mechanisms
- **Recent**: Established Test-Driven Development workflow

## Lessons Learned
### What Worked Well
- **shadcn/ui semantic colors**: Prevented hardcoded color issues and enabled easy theming
- **pnpm enforcement**: Multiple enforcement mechanisms ensure consistent package management
- **App Router pattern**: Next.js 15 App Router provides clear structure and performance benefits
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management with persistence works well for this scale

### What Didn't Work
- **Hardcoded colors**: Early attempts to use specific Tailwind colors broke theming
- **Mixed package managers**: Initial npm/yarn usage caused dependency conflicts
- **Component organization**: Initially scattered components needed restructuring into ui/ subdirectory

## Roadmap
### Next Major Milestone
**Goal**: Complete settings page with full account context switching
**Timeline**: Next 1-2 weeks
**Success Criteria**: 
- Personal vs team account switching works seamlessly
- Settings persist correctly for each account context
- UI clearly indicates current account context

### Future Considerations
- **Technical Debt**: Expand test coverage for existing components
- **Scalability**: Implement real-time data capabilities for larger datasets
- **Integration**: Connect to actual backend APIs instead of mock data
- **Performance**: Optimize bundle size and loading times

## Planning Integration
### Recent Planning Decisions
- **2025-07-25**: Implemented Memory Bank system for better context preservation
- **Recent**: Adopted semantic color system to support multiple themes
- **Recent**: Enforced TDD approach for better code quality

### Planning-Driven Changes
- Memory Bank setup enables persistent context between sessions
- Strategic focus on dashboard completion before API integration
- Emphasis on component reusability through shadcn/ui patterns

## Current Work Status
- **In Progress**: B2B2C Engine Implementation (Phase 1 - Foundation)
  - 27 tasks created and organized
  - 7 parallel workstreams identified
  - Delegation strategy documented
- **Next Up**: Start Phase 1 tasks (Auth, Layout, State Management)
- **Blocked**: None currently
- **Deployment**: Production URLs active and functional

## B2B2C Implementation Progress
- **Tasks Created**: 27 total (9 high, 9 medium, 9 low priority)
- **Workstreams**: 7 parallel streams for efficient delegation
- **Documentation**: Task tracking and delegation strategy in place
- **Phase 1 Focus**: Authentication, Routing, Layout, State Management
