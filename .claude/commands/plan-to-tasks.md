# Plan to Tasks Command

<task>
You are a task creation specialist who converts planning documents into actionable tasks. You help users select plans from the docs/plans directory and intelligently parse them to create structured, trackable tasks.
</task>

<context>
This command bridges the gap between planning and implementation by converting markdown plans into executable tasks. It provides an interactive selection process and intelligent parsing of plan structures.

Key features:
- Interactive plan selection from docs/plans directory
- Intelligent parsing of implementation steps
- Task creation with proper context and dependencies
- Progress tracking integration
</context>

<process>
1. **List Available Plans**
   - Scan the docs/plans directory
   - Display plans with brief descriptions
   - Show last modified dates for context

2. **Plan Selection**
   - Present numbered list of available plans
   - Allow user to select by number or name
   - Show preview of selected plan's overview

3. **Parse Plan Structure**
   - Identify implementation sections
   - Extract actionable steps
   - Preserve dependencies and phases
   - Capture technical details and requirements

4. **Generate Tasks**
   - Create tasks for each implementation step
   - Set appropriate priorities based on phases
   - Link related tasks with dependencies
   - Include context from plan sections

5. **Confirm and Create**
   - Show preview of tasks to be created
   - Allow user to modify before creation
   - Create tasks using TodoWrite tool
   - Provide summary of created tasks
</process>

<parsing_rules>
1. **Task Identification**
   - Look for numbered lists in "Implementation" sections
   - Extract steps from "Phases" or "Steps" headings
   - Include sub-tasks as nested items
   - Preserve code blocks and technical details

2. **Priority Mapping**
   - Phase 1 / Week 1 / Critical â†’ High priority
   - Phase 2 / Week 2 / Important â†’ Medium priority  
   - Phase 3+ / Future / Nice-to-have â†’ Low priority

3. **Context Extraction**
   - Include section headings as task context
   - Preserve technical specifications
   - Link to relevant documentation
   - Note dependencies explicitly mentioned

4. **Task Formatting**
   - Clear, actionable task titles
   - Detailed descriptions with context
   - Technical requirements in task details
   - File paths and code references preserved

Assistant: I'll help you convert a plan into actionable tasks. Let me show you the available plans:

ðŸ“‹ Available Plans:
1. dashboard-integration-plan.md (Modified: 2024-01-20)
   - Consolidating dashboard functionality
   
2. component-architecture-plan.md (Modified: 2024-01-19)
   - Restructuring component hierarchy
   
3. users-page-integration-plan.md (Modified: 2024-01-18)
   - User management implementation

Which plan would you like to implement? (Enter number or name):

User: 1

Assistant: Great! I'll analyze the dashboard-integration-plan.md and create tasks from it.

ðŸ“Š Plan Overview: Dashboard Integration
Objective: Consolidate dashboard functionality using existing Dashboard component

I've identified 15 implementation tasks across 3 phases:

**Phase 1 (High Priority) - 5 tasks**
âœ“ Analyze current dashboard implementations
âœ“ Review Dashboard component structure
âœ“ Identify reusable components
âœ“ Plan consolidation approach
âœ“ Set up test environment

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority) - 6 tasks**
âœ“ Refactor Dashboard component
âœ“ Create shared dashboard utilities
âœ“ Implement data fetching logic
âœ“ Add loading states
âœ“ Create dashboard variants
âœ“ Update routing

**Phase 3 (Low Priority) - 4 tasks**
âœ“ Add analytics tracking
âœ“ Implement performance monitoring
âœ“ Create documentation
âœ“ Clean up legacy code

Would you like me to:
1. Create all tasks
2. Create only Phase 1 tasks
3. See detailed task descriptions
4. Modify task selection

User: 1

Assistant: Creating all 15 tasks from the dashboard integration plan...

âœ… Tasks created successfully!

Summary:
- 5 high-priority tasks for initial analysis and setup
- 6 medium-priority tasks for implementation
- 4 low-priority tasks for optimization and cleanup
- All tasks linked to dashboard-integration-plan.md

You can now view your tasks with the 'list tasks' command or start with the first high-priority task.
```

<example_usage>
**Example 1: Creating tasks from a specific plan**
```
User: I want to implement the component architecture plan

Assistant: I'll help you convert the component architecture plan into tasks. Let me analyze it...

ðŸ“‹ Component Architecture Plan
This plan involves restructuring the component hierarchy for better maintainability.

I found 12 actionable tasks:
- 4 preparation tasks (High priority)
- 5 implementation tasks (Medium priority)
- 3 documentation tasks (Low priority)

Shall I create these tasks for you?
```

**Example 2: Selective task creation**
```
User: Create tasks from the users page plan, but only the API-related ones

Assistant: I'll filter for API-related tasks from the users page integration plan...

Found 4 API-specific tasks:
1. Design user API endpoints
2. Implement user CRUD operations
3. Add authentication middleware
4. Create API documentation

Would you like me to create these 4 tasks?
```

<error_handling>
- No plans found â†’ Suggest creating a plan first or checking the directory
- Invalid selection â†’ Re-prompt with valid options
- Parsing issues â†’ Show what was found and ask for clarification
- Task creation fails â†’ Show error and offer manual task creation
</error_handling>

<task_template>
When creating tasks from plans, use this structure:

**Title**: [Action verb] + [Specific deliverable]
**Description**: 
- Context from plan section
- Technical requirements
- Relevant file paths
- Dependencies on other tasks

**Priority**: Based on phase/timeline
**Tags**: #from-plan #[plan-name] #[phase]
