  title: "Create responsive layout components (CEO / Worker / Frontliner)"
  workstream: "Layout & Navigation"
  phase: "Phase 1 â€“ Foundation"
  priority: "high"
  description: |
    Build the top-level responsive layouts for the three user dashboards.
    Each layout must share the same header/navbar component but use a role-specific sidebar.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - CEO, Worker, Frontliner pages render without runtime errors at `/ceo`, `/worker`, `/frontliner`.
    - Viewport widths 375px, 768px, 1280px show no horizontal scroll.
    - Uses only shadcn/ui primitives; colors via semantic Tailwind classes.
    - Layout resides in src/components/layout/RoleLayout.tsx with props `role` (ceo | worker | frontliner) and children content.
    - Storybook story (or Playwright snapshot) demonstrates three roles.
    - Jest test asserts sidebar items render per role.
  tasks:
    - Generate new component with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add sidebar` (if not present).
    - Create `RoleLayout.tsx` composed of Navbar + Sidebar + main content.
    - Add sample routes in `src/app/(dashboard)` for each role with placeholder content.
    - Write tests `src/__tests__/layout/RoleLayout.test.tsx`.
