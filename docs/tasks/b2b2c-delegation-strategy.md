---

### Workstream 6: Dashboard Components (Depends on Layout)
**Dependencies**: Workstream 2 (layouts)
**Estimated Time**: 5-6 days
**Skills Needed**: React, Business Logic, UI Components

#### Tasks:
1. Create CEO dashboard components
2. Build Worker dashboard components
3. Develop Frontliner mobile components
4. Connect components to API endpoints
5. Assemble all components

**Deliverables**:

## 📊 Parallelization Matrix

| Phase | Can Start Immediately | Depends on Others | Est. Days |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Immediate Start** |
| Workstream 1 (Auth) | ✅ | - | 3-4 |
| Workstream 2 (Layout) | ✅ | - | 2-3 |
| Workstream 4 (State) | ✅ | - | 3 |
| Workstream 5 (Design) | ✅ | - | 2 |
| **Second Wave** |
| Workstream 3 (Routing) | ⏳ | Auth (partial) | 2 |
| Workstream 6 (Dashboards) | ⏳ | Layout | 5-6 |
| **Third Wave** |
| Workstream 7 (Real-time) | ⏳ | State | 3-4 |
| Workstream 5 (Implementation) | ⏳ | State | 3-4 |

## 👥 Suggested Team Allocation

### Solo Developer Approach
**Week 1**: Focus on Workstreams 1, 2, 4 (Foundation)
**Week 2**: Move to Workstreams 3, 5, 6 (Core Features)
**Week 3**: Complete with Workstream 7 (Polish & Performance)

### Team Approach (3 Developers)
**Developer A**: Workstreams 1 & 3 (Auth & Routing)
**Developer B**: Workstreams 2 & 6 (UI & Dashboards)
**Developer C**: Workstreams 4, 5 & 7 (State, Data & Performance)

### Pair Programming Approach
**Pair 1**: Backend focus - Auth, State, Real-time
**Pair 2**: Frontend focus - Layout, Dashboards, Visualizations

## 🔄 Critical Path

The critical path for the project follows this sequence:
1. **Auth & Layout** (can be parallel) → 
2. **Routing** (needs auth) + **State Management** →
3. **Dashboard Components** (needs layout) + **Readiness Index** →
4. **Real-time & Integration** →
5. **Testing & Optimization**

## 📝 Delegation Guidelines

### For Each Workstream:
1. **Clear Interface Definition**: Define inputs/outputs before starting
2. **Component Contracts**: Use TypeScript interfaces for all components
3. **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests for each component
4. **Documentation**: README for each workstream
5. **Review Process**: PR review before integration

### Communication Points:
- Daily standup to sync on interfaces
- Shared types/interfaces in a central location
- Component storybook for visual components
- API mocking for parallel development

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Parallel Efficiency**: 40% time savings through parallelization
- **Integration Success**: <1 day for component integration
- **Code Quality**: 90%+ test coverage per workstream
- **Performance**: Meet all performance targets in plan

## 🚦 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Bottlenecks:
1. **Auth delays** → Start with mock auth for other streams
2. **State design changes** → Use adapter pattern for flexibility
3. **Component integration** → Define interfaces early
4. **Performance issues** → Build performance tests from start

### Mitigation Strategies:
- Mock services for parallel development
- Feature flags for gradual integration
- Continuous integration from day 1
- Regular integration checkpoints

This delegation strategy enables maximum parallelization while maintaining code quality and integration success. Teams can work independently on their workstreams with clear interfaces and minimal blocking dependencies.
