## Overview
This document tracks all tasks created from the B2B2C Engine Implementation Plan. The implementation focuses on creating a multi-faceted dashboard system with three distinct user types: CEO, Worker, and Frontliner.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - High Priority ⚡

### Layout & Navigation
- [ ] **Create responsive layout components** - Build responsive layouts for CEO, Worker, and Frontliner dashboards
- [ ] **Implement role-based routing** - Add automatic redirection based on user role
- [ ] **Set up navigation structure** - Create navigation for all three user facets

### Authentication & Permissions
- [ ] **Extend authentication with roles** - Add support for CEO, Worker, Frontliner roles
- [ ] **Implement permission middleware** - Create role-specific access control
- [ ] **Add session management** - Handle multiple user types with role context persistence

### State & Data Management
- [ ] **Configure Zustand stores** - Set up stores for each dashboard type
- [ ] **Implement API aggregation** - Reduce network requests by 40%
- [ ] **Set up real-time sync** - Add WebSocket connections for live data

## Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2-3) - Medium Priority 🔨

### Readiness Index Visualization
- [ ] **Create visualization components** - Build radar charts, progress bars, heat maps
- [ ] **Implement calculation algorithms** - Add weighted metrics calculations
- [ ] **Build drill-down interfaces** - Enable hierarchical data exploration

### Dashboard-Specific Components
- [ ] **CEO dashboard components** - Executive summaries, KPIs, strategic planning tools
- [ ] **Worker dashboard components** - Team management, analytics, reporting tools
- [ ] **Frontliner mobile components** - Forms, status updates, offline capability

### Data Integration
- [ ] **Connect to API endpoints** - Wire up all dashboard components
- [ ] **Implement caching strategies** - Add Redis for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Add real-time updates** - Enable live updates across components

## Phase 3: Component Delegation & Integration (Week 4) - Low Priority 📋

### Component Standards
- [ ] **Define component contracts** - Create clear interfaces for delegation
- [ ] **Create documentation** - Comprehensive component docs
- [ ] **Establish testing requirements** - Write component tests

### Delegation Process
- [ ] **Set up development workflow** - Team delegation process
- [ ] **Create review process** - Integration guidelines
- [ ] **Implement integration testing** - Test component interactions

### Final Integration
- [ ] **Assemble all components** - End-to-end testing
- [ ] **Optimize performance** - Meet <2s dashboard load time target
- [ ] **Establish deployment pipeline** - CI/CD for B2B2C engine
