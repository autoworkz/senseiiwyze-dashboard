# Comprehensive Readiness Score System Guide

## Overview

The Readiness Score is the **central aggregation metric** for executive oversight, providing a single, comprehensive view of organizational readiness across all dimensions. This system calculates a weighted score from multiple data sources to give C-suite leaders actionable insights into workforce capability and strategic alignment.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**The Readiness Score answers the fundamental executive question: "How prepared is our organization to achieve its strategic objectives?"**

- **Single Source of Truth**: One metric that aggregates all readiness factors
- **Real-time Insights**: Live calculation from current data sources
- **Actionable Intelligence**: Specific recommendations for improvement
- **Strategic Alignment**: Directly tied to business outcomes
- **Risk Awareness**: Built-in risk assessment and mitigation
