EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I.
During  pandemic,  U.S.  after-tax  corporate  profits
climbed to 11.8 % of GDP—the richest share since
the  1950s.  CEOs  now  want  those  margins  every
year—without  a  public-relations  fiasco.    Since  the
pandemic their playbook has been to automate both
cognitive and manual tasks with digital infrastructure
-  AI,  Cloud  Computing  and  robots,  laying  the
pathway  to  supercharged  profit  margins  until  2024
when inflation increased cost and now tariffs. They
have  deployed  4.28  million  industrial  robots
already operating in factories in 2023 — a 10 % YoY
rise as well as 72% are using generative AI in at least
1  function.  McKinsey  and  Deloitte  report  human
adoption
the  choke-point  as  only  37%  of
companies  have  invested  in  change  management
and new-skill incentives, stalling AI adoption curves.
AI is a cultural shift that requires investment in tech
training, coaching and a culture audit to usher in the
transformation and profitability CEOs desire.

is

Our 5-year goal is to expose 10 million economically disadvantaged individuals to tech skill coaching to
eliminate  the  human  adoption  issue  that  has  slowed  AI  adoption.  We  plan  to  grow  revenue  to  $
275,000,000  million  dollars  by  2029.    Our  ultimate  goal  is  to  generate  $1  billion  in  revenue  annually,
exiting business via M&A or IPO by 2030. To achieve this goal we are returning to our roots as a national
organization following BEAD deployment which begins October 1, 2025.

Automation Workz has grown in revenue 335% since 2020. In 2025, we began laying the foundation for
our an atmospheric growth.

WHY  NOW?  Automation  Workz  was  built  on the  assertion  that technology  transformation  is  built  on
changing  the  culture  of  both  corporations  and  front-liners  to  achieve  massive  profitability.  Front-liners

addicted  to  video  games  and  consumer  technology  are  capable  of  becoming  skilled  technicians  to
execute transformation, especially since the Federal government is investing $42.5 billion for the BEAD
(Broadband, Equity, Access and Deployment) initiative will train 200,000 new workers to lay fiber optics
in internet deserts accelerating AI, Robots and cloud computing.

BEAD  funding  has  accelerated  the
sense  of  urgency  for  everyone  as
strong internet service is needed to
deploy  data  centers  that  are  being

BEAD funding and AI Adoption is a
perfect storm for Automation Workz
to  scale  its  tech  skill  coaching
platform  across  the  entire  United
States  of  America  and  generate
massive  impact  while  generating
substantial  profits  as  states  will  be
employing  network  and  broadband

Thirteen states, including Michigan, will receive over $1 billion in BEAD Funding, laying the foundation
for our expansion.

HISTORY

II.
On the DDOT bus, in 2017, a person asked me for a paper bus schedule. I told them I use Google maps
to navigate my bus ride. As we were discussing the issue, the Grand River bus, which is normally rowdy
with 80 people, got so quiet, I could hear a pin drop.

I stood up and asked, “Does anyone else need this
lesson?” Everyone on the bus rose their hand, like
they were in a classroom. I ran to the front of the bus
and gave a Google maps lesson.

When I was stepping off the bus, the driver states, “I
have never seen such a thing!” I had not, either. I
realized  many  Detroiters  owned smartphones,  even
in the midst of the proverbial digital divide, meaning
they  desired  to  learn  about  technology.  The  rowdy
bus was eager to learn.

I immediately got off the bus and over several months created a pilot, Automation Workz, to assist front-
liners prepare for tech certification in network engineering, cybersecurity ops, and Internet of Things. We
graduated  our  first  4  learners,  May  2019.  We  discovered  the  financial  struggles  of  life  caused
economically disadvantaged young people to drop out of training.

Automation  Workz  officially  began  March  18,  2019  when  we  received  our  State  of  Michigan  license.
Operation began in 2020 as an Income Share Agreement school, serving those with Bachelor’s degree
in liberal arts who desired to move into tech careers. These learners signed an agreement to pay back
tuition over 3 years after they received a higher-paying career. We financed training with a $10 million
dollar line of credit from Blair, Inc.

Automation  Workz  had
in  California,  Florida,
learners
Georgia,  Indiana,  Maryland,  Michigan,  Ohio,  Pennsylvania,
Texas and Wisconsin.

Federal  government  ruled  ISA  investors  like  Blair  did  not
provide  Truth-In-Lending  disclosures  to  individual  learners
and thus made the financing arrangement nonprofitable. We
had been adding workforce development funding since 2020
and accelerated it in 2021 as it had no interest payments, no
receivable  commitments  and  payment  is  received  within  60
days. Blair $10 million Line of Credit ended in 2022.

In 2021, Automation Workz was ranked as one of the nation’s
top  10  Cybersecurity  Bootcamps  by  Career  Karma  and
named  one  of  the  top  10  Best  Cybersecurity  Bootcamps  2022  and  2023  by  Intelligent.com  having
increased front-liner training completion rates from 7.93% to 75% and average graduate annual salaries
from $31,200 to $67,250. The Automation Workz highest graduate has achieved $166,000, after 3 years
of employment with 30% of graduates earning over $70,000.

1.  Front-liner  completes  diagnostic  assessments  on  their  cell  phone.  Most  front-liners  do  not  have  a

dedicated computer to use at work.

2. Automation Workz creates a profile based on their diagnostic assessment.
3. The profile is analyzed by AI and predictive data is transmitted into an institutional dashboard.
4. If  institution  decides to  train front-liners,  Automation  Workz  offers  programs  in  AI  &  Data  Analytics,
cybersecurity, Internet of Things – Tech Support and network engineering (broadband). Programs are
part-time with 3 hours of group coaching and AI-graded simulation labs over a 12-48 week time period,
depending upon the specialty.

AI provides this analysis that includes Program Readiness Dashboard of what program a learner is ready
to complete, a synopsis on how close a learner is to other rigorous programs, what is necessary to coach
them to be ready for other specialties and what other soft/ culturally adaptive skills do they possess.

DUAL MARKETING STRATEGY

IV.
Automation Workz utilizes a dual-sided marketing strategy within a two-sided platform model, similar to
Salesforce. We train economically disadvantaged end-users (front-liners) into middle-skilled roles while
simultaneously,  engaging  institutional  customers  who  pay  our  fees,  how  to  change  their  culture  to
accelerate adoption of emerging tech, like AI. This B2B2C dual-sided marketing strategy ensures that
front-liners  demand  for  training/promotion  and  institutional  demand  grows  symbiotically—each  driving
value to the other thus maximizing our market traction and systemic impact.

Automation Workz caters to the industrious employees - front-liners who have visions for a better life
and the executives managing them who desires to secure promotion as well.
