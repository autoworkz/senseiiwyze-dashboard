## üîÑ Structure Change Protocol

### How to Modify Structure Mid-Flight

```yaml
change_request_process:
  1_identify:
    - What: "Component needs different props"
    - Impact: "Affects 2 other components"
    - Urgency: "HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW"
    
  2_communicate:
    - Post in: "#senseii-dev"
    - Tag: "@affected-developers"
    - Template: "CHANGE: [component] needs [modification] because [reason]"
    
  3_implement:
    quick_changes:  # < 30 min
      - Add optional props
      - Change styling
      - Add new mock data fields
      
    breaking_changes:  # Needs coordination
      - Change component interface
      - Modify routing structure
      - Update data schema

structure_flexibility_rules:
  - Keep interfaces loose initially (many optional props)
  - Use composition over inheritance
  - Mock data can be changed anytime
  - Style changes don't block functionality
```

## üîå Integration Points

### Shared Components Registry
```javascript
// src/components/shared/index.ts
export { Layout } from './Layout'
export { KPICard } from './KPICard'
export { DataTable } from './DataTable'
export { ProgressRing } from './ProgressRing'
export { FilterPanel } from './FilterPanel'

// Each dev adds their exports here
```

### Mock API Structure
```javascript
// src/services/mockApi.ts
export const mockApi = {
  // Executive Dashboard
  getKPIs: async () => ({ 
    completion: 87.3,
    costPerCompletion: 284,
    atRiskCount: 23,
    readinessIndex: 58.4
  }),
  
  // Team Dashboard
  getLearners: async (filters) => ({
    data: [...],
    total: 156,
    page: 1
  }),
  
  // My Progress
  getMyMetrics: async (userId) => ({
    skillFit: 73,
    visionAlignment: 0.82,
    gameIndex: 0.91
  })
}
```

## üèÅ Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Each developer runs these
git checkout -b feature/[TASK-ID]
npm run dev
npm run mock-api

# Component generator
npm run generate component [ComponentName]

# Test your page
npm run test:page [pageName]
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Daily Standup Template
```yaml
yesterday:
  - Completed: [Component names]
  - Blockers: [Any issues]

today:
  - Working on: [Task IDs]
  - Need from others: [Dependencies]

questions:
  - [Any integration concerns]
```

### Slack Channels
- `#senseii-dev` - General development
- `#senseii-blockers` - Urgent issues
- `#senseii-pr` - PR reviews
- `#senseii-demo` - Share progress

## üéØ Success Metrics

**Day 3 Goal**: All pages load with mock data
**Day 4 Goal**: Navigation works between all pages
**Day 5 Goal**: Ready for backend integration

This structure allows everyone to work independently while maintaining clear integration points and communication channels.
